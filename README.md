# DefenderFramework

This repository contains long-term base code used by the Dutton Christian School Defenders robotics team.
- **DefenderBot**: this directory contains code to be subclassed for an actual robot. This code can be used to develop a robot. Any actual programming of the bot inside an opmode is a separate task.
- **DefenderStateMachine**: this directory contains code that can be used to program a DefenderBot using event and command style programming.
